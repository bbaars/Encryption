# Encryption
Encryption/Decryption using a custom Linked List


Has the user enter a string in which they would like to encrypt it. They then have the ability to maniuplate the string 
anyway they'd like. 

Each manipulation is stored in a text file where the decryption algorithm would read and reverse the string back to normal.

Implements my own linked list
